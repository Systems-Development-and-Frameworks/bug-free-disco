### How to submit homework

You have to create a feature branch first, commit your code and push it to your
copy of the homework repository. Then create a pull request with your feature
branch as the target branch and request a review from your teachers.

![create pull request](./.github/img/create_pr.png)

Make sure that you *watch* the original homework repository. That's where we
update exercise descriptions. Keep your own copy up-to-date by merging in new
commits of the original repository.

![watch home repository](./.github/img/watch_repo.png)

Do not submit lengthy pull request. Pull requests with a large `diff` in
`Files changed` tab are difficult to review. If you want to get good feedback on
your pull requests, don't push unrelated changes.
