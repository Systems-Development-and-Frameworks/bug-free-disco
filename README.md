## Homework - Exercise #0

1. Find team members to groups of 2-3 people. Together, come up with a team name (Team names must be url-safe). We will setup a team on Github and Moodle for you. Kudos for a team name with a corresponding emoji. 
2. Make a copy of this repository (using a second remote). Ensure that each member of your team has sufficient access. :star:
3. Replace the content of this `README.md` with your individual content. Here's a Github [README.md template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) and there are more [awesome READMEs](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) out there. :star:

You can also have a look on the community checklist to get inspiration:

### How to submit homework

You have to create a feature branch first, commit your code and push it to your
copy of the homework repository. Then create a pull request with your feature
branch as the target branch and request a review from your teachers.

![create pull request](./.github/img/create_pr.png)

Make sure that you *watch* the original homework repository. That's where we
update exercise descriptions. Keep your own copy up-to-date by merging in new
commits of the original repository.

![watch home repository](./.github/img/watch_repo.png)

Do not submit lengthy pull request. Pull requests with a large `diff` in
`Files changed` tab are difficult to review. If you want to get good feedback on
your pull requests, don't push unrelated changes.
